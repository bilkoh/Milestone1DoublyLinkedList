# Doubly Linked List Implementation
- for CSC 340 Programming Methodologies
- uses a hashmap for more efficient finding of nodes based on key
- implements testing via GTest [See test_main.cc](https://github.com/bilkoh/Milestone1DoublyLinkedList/blob/main/test_main.cc)

## How to build
Run these commands in the main directory:
```
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```
You can then run the binary in linux:
```
./build/Milestone1
```
Or in Windows:
```
.\build\Debug\Milestone1.exe
```


## Todo
- Double check testCase2 to testCase5
- create a solutions file to make it easier for grader.
